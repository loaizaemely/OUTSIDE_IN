                <p>
                    The temporal bones are a pair of bilateral, symmetrical bones that make up a large portion of the lateral wall and base of the skull. They are very irregular bones that present several muscular insertions and articulations with neighboring bones.<br><br>

                    There are a large number of holes and canals in the temporal bone through which structures enter and leave the cranial cavity. The temporal bone also contains the structures that make up the middle and inner ear.

                    The temporal bone is responsible for protecting important vascular and neurological structures, including the internal carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the internal organs of hearing.<br>
                    Although the temporal bone is a thick and strong bone and requires significant trauma to fracture, when these injuries occur they have a high degree of complications and can even lead to death.<br>
                    Its main function is to protect the brain. Together with the neighboring bony structures, it is responsible for protecting the important neurological and vascular elements that are found within it.

                    It is the largest part of the bone. It is also known as temporal scale or temporal shell. It is shaped like a convex plate and is located on the top and sides of the skull. It has an external and an internal face.<br>
                     On the surface of the external face there is a groove that allows the passage of the posterior deep temporal artery. It also has a depression, located in the lower part, called the mandibular fossa. That is the site where the temporal bone articulates with the mandible.

                <p>
                    It is located posterior to the squamous portion. On its posterior edge it is in contact with the occipital bone and a projection called the mastoid process is evident in that area.<br>
                     The mastoid portion contains cells or air grooves that can become infected when there is contamination of the middle ear, generating a condition, mainly of the pediatric age, called mastoiditis.

                <p>
                    Inferior to the squamosal portion, it is a curved area that forms the anterior limit of the mastoid process. Its upper surface is concave and constitutes the posterior wall of the internal auditory canal.<br><br>

                     Its lower face is flatter and is in contact with the mandibular portion of the parotid gland.
                     At its lower border it has a projection that projects anteriorly called the styloid process. This bony projection is located just below the ear and serves as the point of attachment for various muscles of the tongue and larynx.

                <p>
                    It is a complex part in the form of a pyramid with the vertex towards the inner side. It contains both some of the most important structures of the middle ear and vital vascular structures, which pass through this portion through holes specific to each one.<br><br>

                    It is widely used for the study of ancient corpses since it usually preserves important traces of DNA that cannot be found in other bone remains.
