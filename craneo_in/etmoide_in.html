                    It is a porous and unique bone that contributes to a lesser extent to the middle portion of the neurocranium, its main contribution is to the viscerocranium.<br>
                    It is an important part of the skull and is made up of 2 layers:<br><br>

                    <strong>* Vertical sheet: </strong> It is divided into two portions, one superior, located above the horizontal plate, within the cranial cavity, known as the crista galli apophysis; another lower one, located below said plate, forms part of the partition separating both nostrils, and is called the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid.<br>
 
                    <strong>* Horizontal or sieve plate: </strong>  allows the passage of olfactory fibers so that we can perceive odors.
                    And by two parts known as lateral masses.

            <p>
                Located in the cranial vault, it is limited by the frontal bone in its lower area, and in the front area is the cranial base, which has the function of joining with the bony structures of the face. In addition, the eye orbits and the lacrimal bone are located on its upper part. And finally, in the middle of the frontal bone and the ethmoid bone, the sphenoid bone can be located.
            </p>

            <h2 id="funciones">FUNCTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                * Collaborates with the formation of the orbit, nasal cavity, nasal septum and floor of the anterior cranial fossa.<br><br>

                * Is part of the skull and to protect the brain from external factors, it also allows a part of the outer layer of the meninges (dura mater) to pass through the ethmoid ducts and grooves, passing the olfactory nerve, the ophthalmic nerve, the ethmoidal artery, the nasal nerve, among others.<br><br>

                * Its main function is the "assembly" of all the bony structures of the skull.<br><br>

                * It can be said that it forms and connects the bone base for the correct functioning of the senses of vision, smell, hearing and taste.<br><br>

                * It participates in the conformation of the nasal and orbital cavities, and due to its reliefs, notches, depressions and orifices, it allows the nasal air function for breathing, phonation and smell capture.<br><br>

                *It is specially designed to contain the nerve roots of the olfactory nerve and contribute to the formation and protection of the air spaces.<br><br>

                *Likewise, its apophysis, crista galli, serves as an insertion for the falx cerebri, also called "falx cerebri" that separates the brain, differentiating the right hemisphere from the left hemisphere..<br><br>

            <h2 id="anatomia">ANATOMY</h2>
            <p>
                The ethmoid bone consists of four main components including:<br><br>

                °Ethmoid labyrinths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                °Cribriform plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ° Perpendicular sheet.

                <p>
                    It has a square shape, is thin and extends downwards. Its upper border corresponds to the base of the crista galli process.<br>

                    The lower border is rough and bifurcated, where the cartilaginous portion of the nasal septum is lodged. An anterior border corresponding to the spinal nasal of the frontal.<br>

                    Its posterior border, more sinuous, bifurcates in its upper part to articulate with the crest of the sphenoid bone. In its lower part it corresponds to the vomer bone.

                    It has a rectangular and elongated shape, arranged horizontally, and is articulated with the frontal part through the ethmoid notch of the frontal part.<br><br>

                    The crista galli process divides this lamina into two portions. One right and one left, called olfactory grooves, which are perforated by multiple holes through which the olfactory nerves, the anterior ethmoid nerve and the anterior ethmoid artery pass.

            <p>
                On each of the sides of the cribriform plate, two structures called ethmoidal labyrinths project downwards, they are complex structures in themselves, for which up to 6 faces with different characteristics can be described.<br><br>

                On these faces, the anterior ethmoidal cells can be differentiated on its anterior face where it articulates with the lacrimal bone, the middle ethmoidal cells on its superior face where it articulates with the frontal bone, and the posterior ethmoidal cells on its posterior face where it articulates. with the body of the sphenoid.<br><br>

                The ethmoidal cells can only be seen in a fully articulated skull, since they are formed by the union of structures in the articulation of two bones specifically designed for it.
