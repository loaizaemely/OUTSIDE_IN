                <h2>OCCIPITAL</h2>
                <p>
                    It is an unpaired bone that covers the back of the head. It forms a large part of the basilar portion of the neurocranium and is responsible for completely housing the cerebellum. <br>
                    The occiput is the only bone in the skull that articulates with the cervical spine, as well as with many other bones in the skull. For this reason we describe the occipital bone and its parts as: basilar portion, squamous portion, and lateral or condylar portions (located laterally to the foramen magnum).

            <h2>WHERE IS IT LOCATED?</h2>
            <p>
                Covers the back of the head. It constitutes a large part of the basilar part of the neurocranium and houses the entire cerebellum.
            </p>

            <h2 id="b_s">EDGES AND SUTURES</h2>
            <p>
                The upper and lateral border of the occipital bone forms part of the lambdoid suture, which separates it from the parietal bones. It articulates with the mastoid process by the occipitomastoid suture and the petrooccipital suture unites it with the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The sphenooccipital suture, between the sphenoid bone and the basilar portion of the occipital bone, disappears when these bones fuse during adolescence. <br>
                Superolateral: lambdoid suture, which separates it from the parietal bones
                Inferolateral: occipitomastoid suture, which separates it from the mastoid process
                Lower: petrooccipital suture, which separates it from the petrous portion of the temporal bone.
            </p>

            <h2>FORAMENS</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Foramen magnum: </strong> traversed by the medulla oblongata, accessory nerves, vertebral arteries, anterior and posterior spinal arteries, tectorial membrane, alar ligaments. <br>
                <strong>Jugular foramen: </strong> traversed by the inferior petrosal and sigmoid sinuses, glossopharyngeal (IX cranial nerve), vagus (X cranial nerve) and accessory (XI cranial nerve) nerves
                Hypoglossal duct: traversed by the hypoglossal nerve (XII cranial nerve).

                <p>
                    The occipital bone is convex on the outside and concave on the inside. It is divided into four portions: a basilar portion, two lateral (condylar) portions, and a squamous portion. All of these portions are located around a large opening known as the foramen magnum. Structures that pass through the forma magnum include: <br>
                     brainstem (medulla oblongata), spinal branch of accessory nerve, anterior and posterior spinal arteries,
                     vertebral artery and spinal vein.

            <div class="BASILAR">
                <h2>BASILAR PORTION</h2>
                <p>
                    The basilar portion is located anterior to the foramen magnum and adjacent to the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It fuses anteriorly with the sphenoid bone and forms the clivus during adolescence (tribasilar bone). Both the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the pharyngeal raphe insert on the pharyngeal tubercle, which lies on the underside of the basilar portion.

                <p>
                    The condylar portions are lateral masses of the occipital that lie to the sides of the foramen magnum. They consist of two kidney-shaped prominences (occipital condyles) that articulate with the first cervical vertebra (atlanto-occipital joint). <br>
                     Posterior to these are the condylar canals, through which the condylar emissary veins pass and connect the external vertebral venous plexuses with the sigmoid sinus. The hypoglossal nerve exits the neurocranium through the hypoglossal canal, which pierces the lateral portions of the occipital bone.

                <p>
                    The squamous portion is the largest of the four parts of the occipital bone.
                     A palpable prominence, known as the external occipital protuberance, is located in the midline of the external aspect and serves as the attachment point for the trapezius muscle.
                     In addition to this, the external face is characterized by the presence of three curved lines known as nuchal lines: <br>
                     The supreme nuchal line, The nuchal line, The inferior nuchal line, <br>
                     it is marked by grooves on its endocranial (internal) face due to the dural venous sinuses: superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinuses, and sigmoid sinus. Superior to the groove of the transverse sinus, there is a bony depression that serves to accommodate the occipital lobe (cerebral fossa) and a corresponding inferior depression that houses the cerebellum (cerebellar fossa).
